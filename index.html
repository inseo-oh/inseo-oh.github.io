        <small>(Korean name: Ïó∞ÏßÄÏø§, Japanese name: „Çà„Çì„Åò„Åè„Çì(YONJIKUN))</small>
        <p>Hi, I'm YEONJIKUN. I am Korean and live in South Korea. I make music box arrangements on YouTube! Usually
          it's
          Japanese songs, because that's what I often listen to(especially Hololive ones). Visit <a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/@yjk_ch" target="_blank">my YouTube channel</a> to enjoy!
        </p>
        <p>
          I also love computers, and I'm currently studying modern web frontend development(primarily HTML + CSS + JS).
          I
          also have experience with other computer languages in the past, including:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>C, C++, Rust, Go</li>
          <li>Java, C#</li>
          <li>Python, Lua</li>
          <li>Emacs LISP (I mostly forgot about this though)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Bear in mind that I don't call myself as professional for any of these languages.</p>
        <p>Retro computing is also one of my interests, though I don't have or plans for having actual machines. And I'm
          not interested in retro gaming.</p>
        <section id="sec-human-language-skills">
          <h2>Human language skills</h2>
          <h3 id="sec-human-language-skills-kr">Korean</h3>
          <p>
            My native language, though I no longer use it on my channel and social platforms, mainly because I got tired
            of doing translations.
          </p>
          <h3 id="sec-human-language-skills-en">English</h3>
          <p>
            I learned English from acadamy when I was child, and I also probably watched millions of English videos(and
            I
            still do) on YouTube. So I think my English skills are okay, at least for what I do.<br>
            Currently my limitations are:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>My brain's English dictionary is mostly built for technology. In other words, I am not good at words you
              actually use in real life.</li>
            <li>If someone speaks fast, I can't understand very well.</li>
            <li>I'm not confident enough to speak in English, though I can write English just fine.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>So when I open takling live stream from one of Hololive EN members for example, I usually give up watching
            after 1 minute.</p>
          <p>Knowing English was(and is) very helpful for computer adventures, not just because I can easily read the
            program
            code(unless one uses horrifying naming convention), but also I can read reference documentation written in
            English <em>without</em> any help(in most cases).</p>
          <p>I'm also glad that I have OK English skills, because it's pretty tough to find Korean people with
            similar interests to mine, since <a href="#sec-too-deep-into-computing">I've gone too deep into
              computing.</a>
            Almost nobody near me would undestand what I'm talking about.
          <h3 id="sec-human-language-skills-jp">Japanese</h3>
          <p>
            Almost non-existent. I'm slowly learning Japanese, and I can in fact read most Hiragana, and around 60% of
            Katakana I think. But of course I don't know a lot of Japanese words, and Kanji is of course the biggest
            hurdle.<br>
            That being said, in some ways it <em>is</em> similar to Korean, so some words are pretty easy to remember.
            And
            we do learn Kanji(or Hanja in Korean) in school(even though I forgot most of them). So I know meaning of
            some
            characters at least, though this is also a bit problematic when trying to memorize word because something
            like
            this keeps happening:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            Me: Well I don't remember what Ki-Ku was.<br>
            (Then my eyes look at the Kanji character)<br>
            Me: Oh yeah now I remember what it was.
          </blockquote>

          <h2>Computer programs I use</h2>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Writing software code:</b> <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a>, or <a
                href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> with minimal config when I want to save battery life.</li>
            <li><b>Arrangement:</b> <a href="https://github.com/LMMS/lmms">LMMS</a></li>
            <li><b>Making videos:</b> Originally DaVinci Resolve, but nowadays I use my own program written in C to
              generate all videos for my arrangements. Not only I can now just run the program and just let it bake the
              video, but also I have one less thing to worry about subscription model transition, which no matter what
              the
              company says, it is simply inevitable. Companies want more ways to steal money from your pocket. <i>I'm
                looking at you Clip Studio Paint.</i><br>
              <strong>Note that my program for creating videos is not available publically.</strong> My program is
              written
              specifically for my design, and I don't want people replicating my videos using my program with zero
              effort.
            </li>
            <li><b>Operating System:</b> Windows. Linux is okay on desktop, but I use laptop nowadays, and I use battery
              charge limiter software from manufacturer. And unfortunately there is no standard for this feature as far
              as
              I know, and all known methods are manufacturer-specific. And don't have any hopes for my Samsung
              NT500R3W-KD5S laptop.</li>

        <section id="sec-too-deep-into-computing">
          <h2>I've gone too deep into computing</h2>
          <p>I'm pretty sure that I'm one of those people who loves computer <em>too much</em> and have fallen into
            multiple very in-depth topics. Here's some of what I've done over the years:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Watching videos about computer security, especially ones for video game consoles. It's interesting to see
              how game consoles prevent users from running their own software, and also learn how it was broken. And
              enjoy
              some hilarious moments like <a href="https://youtu.be/DUGGJpn2_zY?si=A8K2J3Jy8WVkhhpP&t=2110">how Sony
                managed to "leak" their signing <i>private key</i> thanks to their laughable ECDSA implementation</a>.
            </li>
            <li>Watching videos about vintage UNIX machines(Sun, IBM RS/6000, etc...).</li>
            <li>
              Writing hardware emulation code, though I've never finished any of them. I wrote 6502 and MC68000
              emulators
              in the past, and had partial success with writing my own Apple I and II, C64 emulator. I tried writing
              Atari
              ST
              emulator with goal being booting to EmuTOS desktop, but it never booted properly.
            </li>
            <li>
              Try to make my own OS. I don't do this anymore, as I learned that I can't handle big projects on myself.
              And writing an OS is <em>very</em> big project.<br>
              But during the process, I learned how to write x86-64 assembly, basic concepts about virtual addressing,
              how
              swap memory(or Paging File under Windows) can be implemented, some details about x86 and x86-64
              architecture. And I did write an incredibly bare-bones read-only ext2 filesystem driver, preemptive
              multitasking microkernel, IPC system for two processes to communicate, my own graphics drawing routines,
              etc...
            </li>
          </ul>
        </section>
        <hr>
        <section id="sec-no-more">
          <h2>Things that I don't do anymore</h2>
          <p>Sometimes I start doing something, and then realize how bad I'm at it many, many years later.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><b>Live streaming: </b>I used to do live streaming on Twitch for many years, but without any meaningful
              result. Later, after months of break, I decided to give another shot.<br>
              But while I think I became better at streaming than before, it didn't took too long to realize I didn't
              feel
              comfortable at continuous talking on live. And there's almost nothing I could do other than talking. I
              don't
              play video games, cooking, or anything else really.<br>
              Eventually, I stopped doing live streaming, and decided to focus on studying frontend web development.<br>
              I did try some programming on stream, but not only no existing viewers were interested, but also I just
              didn't feel comfortable when writing code on live.<br>
              The software I used for streaming is of course <a href="https://obsproject.com/" target="_blank">Open
                Broadcaster
                Software</a>.
            </li>
            <li><b>Drawing illusts: </b>I was also drawing illusts because it necessary when I was doing live streaming.
              I
              don't
              ask somebody else to make assets for my contents. If I don't do it myself, I don't feel like it's purely
              my
              content.<br>
              However, while I was clearly getting better than years ago, I think it's still comically bad for any
              serious
              usage. Eventually, not only I stopped drawing things entirely, <em>ALL</em> of my existing music box
              videos
              were recreated with new design with original album art, using the C program I mentioned <a
                href="#sec-programs-i-use">above</a>.<br>
              For the record, I used various painting software over the years:
              <ul>
                <li><a href="https://medibangpaint.com/en" target="_blank">MediBang Paint Pro</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.clipstudio.net/en/" target="_blank">Clip Studio Paint Pro</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://www.gimp.org/" target="_blank">GIMP</a></li>
                <li><a href="https://krita.org/" target="_blank">Krita</a></li>
              </ul>
